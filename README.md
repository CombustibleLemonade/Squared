# Squared
Squared is a game about moving blocks. It can be opened with the the November-3rd build of Godot, found at http://fixnum.org/godot/#latest_complete.
If you want to throw money my way, or download a build of Squared for free, you'll want to look here: http://combustible-lemonade.itch.io/squared.
